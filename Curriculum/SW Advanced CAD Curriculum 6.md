# Lesson 6: Time Saving 

## Setup (~1 minute):
- Open a new SW project.
- Save inside the “My Projects Folder”.

## Introduction (~5 minutes):
- What does the sweep tool do?
- How is the sweep tool different than the loft tool?

## Sketch Mirror:
- The sketch mirror tool allows you to clone sketch entities by reflecting them across a line (like a mirror)

- Create the sketch from Week 1 using the mirror tool

## Sketch Circular Pattern:
- The circular pattern tool for sketches creates a pattern of sketch entities in a certain direction around a circle a number of times
- Revolves around a circle thats centered around a sketch entity

- Can pattern a certain section of the circle by changing the angle parameter

- Can change individual instances to be different than the rest of the group

## Sketch Linear Pattern:
- Creates copies of sketch entities along a line that are spaced apart

## Feature Mirror:
- Mirrors a feature across a line or plane
- Does not create disjoint bodies!

- Does not create disjoint bodies!
