# Lesson 5: More 3D Modeling Tools

## Setup (~1 minute):
- Open a new SW project.
- Save inside the “My Projects Folder”.

## Introduction (~5 minutes):
- What part was made last week and how was it made?
- What does extrude do? 
- What does cut extrude do? 
- What does revolve do?

## Sweep Tool:
1. Create a sketch of a centerline on the top plane.

2. Exit the sketch and click "Sweep" and select the circular cross-section option.

3. **Loft** creates a 3D shape by sweeping a 2D profile along a predefined path.
   - Example uses include pipes, wires, handlebars.
   - Useful for creating objects with complex curves or varying cross-sections.
4. **Circular Cross-section** is simply a shortcut for a circular cross-section.
5. Create a new plane that is coincident to the point at which the path starts.

6. Sketch on the new plane a random cross-section (ellipse, circle, square). Make sure it does not intersect itself!

7. Select **Sketch Profile** and select your sketch.

## Loft Tool:
1. Create a new file.
2. Create a circular profile on the top plane.

3. Create a sketch plane offset from the top plane.

4. Create a larger circular profile on the new plane.

5. Repeat these steps but instead of a larger circular profile, use **Convert Entities** to clone the bottom profile.

6. Select all three sketches and select Loft.

7. Move the green arrow around and see how the loft extrusion changes as a result.

8. **Loft tool** extrudes material between two cross-sectional surfaces that can be guided using guide curves.

## Thin Option/Shell Tool:
1. Click the top and bottom of the vase.
2. Click **Shell** and select the shell thickness.
3. **Shell** hollows out an extrusion leaving open the faces that are selected.
4. Select **Section View** to see the cross-section of the vase.

## Quiz:
1. What is the purpose of the Sweep tool, and what types of objects can it create?
2. How does the Loft tool differ from the Sweep tool in creating 3D shapes?
3. What does the Shell tool do?

## Review:
1. **Sweep Tool**:
2. **Loft Tool**:
3. **Shell Tool**:
