# Lesson 7: Introduction to Assemblies 

## Setup:
- Open a new SW Assembly File

- Save the file inside of the "My Projects" Folder under a new folder called "4 Bar Link Assembly" 

## Introduction:
- Engineers want to see parts and how they fit together. Assemblies allow engineers to take separate part files and orient or combine them together using mates inside of an assembly file.
- Assemblies can become very complex with many individual part files coming together. That is why a clean project folder with good part file names is required to keep a project organized.

## Creating Parts:
- Create the following five parts in the next few minutes 

Frame:

Output Link:

Coupler Link:

Input Link: 

Connector: 

## Importing Parts
- Open the assembly file created during the start of class
- Click Import Parts

## Flexible Parts
- Parts in an assembly can be rigid or flexible
- Flexible parts can move and rotate in the assembly file 
- Fixed parts cannot move nor rotate in the assembly file
- The first part imported to an assembly will automatically default to being rigid  
- Make the Frame a fixed part  
- Make all other parts flexible

## Mates
- In order to connect parts together in an assembly, mates are used

## Coincident Mate
- Connects two entities by sticking them together in one direction
- Mainly used on faces and planes
- Since SolidWorks is in 3D space, all three directions need to be constrained or else the object will move 

## Concentric Mate
- Connects two circles by forcing them to share the same center along a certain axis
- Parts can rotate unless rotation is locked

## Challenge:
- Spend some time to try and connect the pieces of the crank shaft as shown
