## Introduction (~5 minutes):
- Engineers want to see parts and how they fit together. Assemblies allow engineers to take separate part files and orient or combine them together using mates inside of an assembly file.
- Assemblies can become very complex with many individual part files coming together. That is why a clean project folder with good part file names is required to keep a project organized.
